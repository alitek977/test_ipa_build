I want to add a 7-day chart to the Reports screen.

Goal:
Show a chart built from the latest saved readings for the last 7 days (including today if available). It must combine these variables per day:
- Production
- Consumption
- Export OR Withdrawal (dynamic: use the same mode/label logic we already have; do NOT break it)
- Gas Consumed

Data:
- Use the same stored daily records the app already uses for Reports/Feeders/Calculations.
- “Last 7 days” means the most recent 7 days that have data. If there are fewer than 7 saved days, show what exists and display an empty-state message if none.
- Ensure correct sign/formatting for values (negative sign must appear before the number in Arabic too).

UI/UX requirements:
1) Add a section at the top of Reports called:
   - en: "Last 7 Days"
   - ar: "آخر 7 أيام"
2) Chart type:
   - Prefer a clean combined chart:
     - Lines for Production and Consumption
     - Bars for Export/Withdrawal and Gas Consumed
   - If a combined chart is too complex with the current setup, use a multi-line chart (4 lines) as a fallback.
3) X-axis: day labels (e.g., Jan 21 or 21/01). Respect locale.
4) Y-axis: numeric scale; handle different magnitudes reasonably (if needed, use two y-axes or normalize, but keep it readable).
5) Legend:
   - Production
   - Consumption
   - Export/Withdrawal (dynamic label + translation; withdrawal in red like the rest of the app)
   - Gas Consumed
6) Localization:
   - All new text must be translatable (t("...")) in English and Arabic.
   - RTL layout must look correct in Arabic (alignment and ordering).
7) Performance:
   - Memoize the last-7-days data transformation.
   - Do not recompute on every render unnecessarily.

Implementation constraints:
- Prefer using an existing chart dependency already in the project.
- If no chart library exists, add the lightest Expo-friendly option (e.g., react-native-svg + a minimal chart solution) and keep changes minimal.
- Do NOT change existing calculation logic or the current withdrawal/export labeling behavior.
- Modify only the necessary files: Reports screen + any shared data selector/helper + translation files.

Deliverables:
- Exact file paths changed
- Code diff
- Short explanation of how the last 7 days data is selected and mapped to the chart
- Screenshots are not required, but the code must compile and run in Expo/dev build
