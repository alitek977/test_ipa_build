Please extend the Excel export in the Reports screen to include DAILY and MONTHLY aggregation in the .xlsx file.

CURRENT:
- We are adding "Export as Excel" that creates an .xlsx with:
  Sheet 1: Feeders (Feeder Name | End of Day | Difference)
  Sheet 2: Turbines (Turbine Name | End of Day | Difference)
  Sheet 3: Summary (Production, Export/Withdrawal, Consumption, Gas Consumption)

NEW REQUIREMENT:
Add aggregation sheets based on the stored historical daily records:

=====================
1) Daily Aggregation (Last 31 days)
=====================
- Add a sheet: "Daily Summary" (ar: "ملخص يومي")
- It should include up to the last 31 days with available data (or fewer if less exists).
- Each row = one day (sorted by date ascending).
- Columns:
  Date
  Production (MWh)
  Export/Withdrawal (MWh)  [dynamic label per day based on the saved mode for that day]
  Consumption (MWh)
  Gas Consumption (Nm³)

Rules:
- Use the same saved daily report data already used by the app.
- Keep terminology consistent (withdrawal/export).
- Negative sign must be before the number (even in Arabic).

=====================
2) Monthly Aggregation (Last 12 months)
=====================
- Add a sheet: "Monthly Summary" (ar: "ملخص شهري")
- Group the saved daily records by month (YYYY-MM).
- Include up to the last 12 months with data (sorted ascending).
- Each row = one month.
- Columns:
  Month (e.g., 2026-01 or localized format)
  Total Production (sum)
  Total Export OR Total Withdrawal (sum, based on day mode; if mixed modes in the month, handle clearly—see next rule)
  Total Consumption (sum)
  Total Gas Consumption (sum)
  Days Count

Monthly mode rule (important):
- If within the same month there are both export days and withdrawal days, do NOT merge them into one ambiguous column.
  In that case, create TWO separate columns:
    Total Export
    Total Withdrawal
  If the month contains only one mode, you may fill the other as 0.
- Keep labels translated:
  - export / withdrawal
  - تصدير / سحب

=====================
3) Formatting
=====================
- Use clear headers with bold style.
- Auto-size columns if possible (or set reasonable widths).
- Dates should be stored as strings formatted for readability.
- Numeric cells should be numbers, not strings.

=====================
Constraints
=====================
- Do NOT change calculations or stored data structure.
- Only extend Excel export generation and translation files.
- Use Expo-friendly libraries (xlsx + expo-file-system + expo-sharing).
- Keep existing withdrawal/export logic and terminology unchanged (do NOT use "import").

Deliverables:
- Exact files changed
- Code diff
- Short explanation of how daily/monthly grouping is computed
