In my Expo (React Native) app with Supabase, I have a "Monthly Statistics" section that shows aggregated values (number of days, production totals, etc.). 
I want: when the user taps the Monthly Statistics card/section, open a modal (or bottom sheet) that lists ALL saved days for the currently selected month.

UI/UX requirements:
1) Tap Monthly Statistics -> open a modal (nice UI, supports dark/light mode if available).
2) Inside modal:
   - Show a scrollable list of saved days for that month (sorted descending by date).
   - Each row shows:
     - date_key (YYYY-MM-DD)
     - key summary numbers for that day (e.g., production, hours, gas, or whatever is available in our schema)
   - Each row has a "Delete" button (trash icon is fine).
3) Delete behavior:
   - Confirm before deleting (Alert: "Delete this day? This cannot be undone.").
   - On confirm, delete all data for that day so it becomes "as if it was never written":
     - Delete from feeders where daily_data_id = selected day id
     - Delete from turbines where daily_data_id = selected day id
     - Delete from daily_data where id = selected day id
   - Ensure deletions respect RLS (user can only delete their own data).
4) After deleting:
   - Immediately refresh the modal list (removed day disappears).
   - Immediately refresh Monthly Statistics totals (days count and totals update without needing app restart).
   - Show a single success message (no duplicates).
5) Loading states:
   - While fetching month days: show spinner/skeleton.
   - While deleting: disable the delete button for that row (or show "Deleting...").
6) Data fetching:
   - Query Supabase to get all daily_data rows for current user and current month.
   - If needed, join/compute the day summary from existing stored fields.
   - IMPORTANT: date_key is stored as "YYYY-MM-DD" string. Filter by month safely:
     - Compute monthStart and monthEnd strings (YYYY-MM-01 .. nextMonthStart) and query:
       .gte("date_key", monthStart).lt("date_key", nextMonthStart)
7) Code structure:
   - Create a reusable component: MonthDaysModal (or MonthlyDaysListModal).
   - Keep existing logic intact; integrate by calling openModal from Monthly Statistics onPress.
8) Provide:
   - Exact file paths changed
   - Final copy-paste-ready code
   - Brief explanation of the Supabase queries and deletion flow

Constraints:
- Do not remove existing features (guest auth, Excel export, etc.).
- Must work in Expo Go and built APK.
